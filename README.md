I'm a car enthusiast who has worked in the automotive industry for the past 10 years as an automotive technician and even worked at BMW Manufacturing assembling, diagnosing, and repairing production cars. Since a young age, I've always enjoyed learning how and why things worked. When I typed my first console log, I was consumed by the coding world and gained a strong desire to learn how to code and create full stack applications. The natural progression for me was to join App Academy's six month coding bootcamp to learn as much as I can, as quickly as I can, from experienced professionals. I will be completing App Academy's rigorous Software Engineer coding bootcamp at the end of October, but I am far from completing my desire to become a software engineer!
